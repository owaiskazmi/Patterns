# 🔢 Python Patterns

This repository contains small Python programs that generate different patterns using loops.

## Patterns Included

### 1️⃣ Straight Triangle
A triangle made of asterisks that grows with each row.

Example for 5 rows:

*
*  *
*  *  *
*  *  *  *
*  *  *  *  *


### 2️⃣ Numbers in Descending Order
Prints numbers in descending order starting from the input number.

Example for 5:

5  4  3  2  1
4  3  2  1 
3  2  1
2  1
1


### 3️⃣ Inverted Triangle
An inverted triangle using asterisks.

Example for 5 rows:

*  *  *  *  *
*  *  *  *
*  *  *
*  *
*

## Purpose
These programs help practice:
- Loops and nested loops
- Printing and formatting output
- Logic building
- Problem-solving skills

This repo is part of my learning journey as a high school ICS student exploring programming concepts.
